# CodeFlow

CodeFlow is a web application built on Flask that aims to provide a platform for developers to ask and answer programming-related questions. Similar to StackOverflow, CodeFlow allows users to post questions, provide answers, and vote on the best responses.

Users can create an account to participate in the community by asking and answering questions, upvoting or downvoting answers, and commenting on posts. They can also earn reputation points by being helpful and contributing to the community.

CodeFlow features a powerful search engine that allows users to easily find questions and answers on specific topics. Additionally, users can subscribe to tags to receive notifications for questions related to their interests.

The application also offers moderation tools to ensure that the content posted is of high quality and meets the community guidelines. Moderators can edit or delete posts, and suspend or ban users who violate the rules.

CodeFlow is a valuable resource for developers who are looking for solutions to programming problems, seeking advice on best practices, or simply want to share their knowledge with the community.
