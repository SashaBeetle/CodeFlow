# Welcome to CodeFlow

👋 Hi there! CodeFlow is a web application that allows developers to post and answer programming-related questions. It is similar to StackOverflow and was developed using Flask, with a MySQL database and SQLAlchemy as the ORM. The application also makes use of Azure services and the flasgger library for Swagger UI documentation.

# 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with CodeFlow, you'll need to have Python 3 and Flask installed on your machine. Follow the instructions on the official Python and Flask websites to install these dependencies.

Once you have these dependencies installed, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/VitaliySynytskyi/CodeFlow.git`

Then, navigate to the project directory and install the remaining dependencies using the following command:

`cd CodeFlow
pip install -r requirements.txt`

To start the application, simply run:

`python app.py`

This will start the development server on http://localhost:5000.
